Introducing Threads

A thread is the smallest unit of execution that can be scheduled by the operating system. 

A process is a group of associated threads that execute in the same, shared environment.

Single-threaded process is one that contains exactly one thread, whereas a multi-threaded process is one that contains one or more threads.

The property of executing multiple threads and processes at the same time is referred to as concurrency.
